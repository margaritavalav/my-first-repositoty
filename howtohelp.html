          <h4>
            Why it is important:
          </h4>

         <p>Environmental sustainability is important because we need to look out for the future and our world and the next generation in which our children will live in. As we have seen from recent events 2020 has not been treating us well and it may seem like the environment is fighting us back after so many years of harmfulness and pollution. Even though it is late we can still act now because if we don’t there will be no going back. WE NEED TO ACT NOW! </p>

It is wasted in the process of transportation, packaging, and marketing. Some of the food is also wasted by consumers after they purchase it, and then they throw it away. Think about the energy and resources wasted in producing, distributing, and storing food. Reducing food waste can significantly help the environment as well as save you on your grocery bills.<span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
